# RAG-Agent


## RAG Agent
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent that combines the power of LLMs (like OpenAI GPT) with your custom knowledge base to provide accurate, contextual, and source-grounded answers.

## Overview
RAG Agent enhances traditional Large Language Models by enabling them to retrieve relevant information from external data sources before generating responses. This ensures:

Higher accuracy

Real-time knowledge integration

Reduced hallucinations

This project implements a modular and scalable RAG pipeline using:

🧾 Document ingestion & parsing

🧠 Embedding and vector storage

🧲 Semantic search

💬 Conversational AI with context awareness

## Tech Stack
LangChain – for chaining the RAG components

OpenAI / Anthropic Claude – LLM backend

FAISS / Pinecone / Chroma – Vector database

Streamlit / Gradio / Flask – Frontend interface (optional)

Python – Core language

## Features
✅ Upload and parse PDFs, text, CSVs, Notion, and web content

✅ Generate embeddings using OpenAI or HuggingFace

✅ Store and retrieve documents using FAISS or Pinecone

✅ Ask questions in natural language with source references

✅ Streamlit/Gradio UI for chat and file upload

✅ Optional memory, tool usage, and agent routing via LangChain
